Spark -> Initiation -> Gate 0 -> Phase I -> Gate A -> Phase II -> Gate B -> 
			   			       Phase III -> Gate C -> Phase IV -> Gate D -> Phase V

Phase		Description			Participants
Phase I 		Concept				VACI / VHA Innovations / FTL
Phase II 		Feasibility			VACI / VHA Innovations / FTL / OI&T
Phase III		Pilot					VACI / VHA Innovations / FTL / OI&T
Phase IV		Initial Diffusion		VACI / VHA Innovations / FTL / OI&T
Phase V		National Diffusion	OI&T

## Spark
- Client has Initial Concept/Idea

## Initiation
- Client has contacted Innovations, FTL or VACI
- Innovation Coordinator Assigned
- FTL POC Assigned
- FTL Project Created (including a Project ID)

**Actions (Client/IC/FTL POC)**
- Further Formulation of Concept
- Answer the Question - Does this product align to one of the VA Core Initiatives?
	- If No, reformulate, refactor and restructure as to align to one of the Core Initiatives
	- If Yes, proceed
- Market Research (is there a similar product already or similar functionality provided by another product?)

- Request for Information (RFI)
- Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)
- FTL Technical Assessment Complete

## Gate 0
### Gate 0 Close Out Meeting
- IC/FTL POC/FTL Project
- Does the concept align with one of the VA Core Initiatives? (If no, then it doesn’t make it through Gate 0)
- Can the same outcome be achieved using a COTS product? (If yes, then it doesn’t make it through Gate 0)

## Gate 0 Output
Concept portfolio 
Business case analysis 
Organizational partners and sponsors
Initial Marketing Strategy
Initial Diffusion Strategy

## Begin Phase I
